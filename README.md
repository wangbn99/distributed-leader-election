Leader election is a important algorithm in distributed computing. By [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_election) It is the process of designating a single process as the organizer of some task distributed among several computers (nodes).

In this project, we will use RabbitMQ to implement a distributed leader election algorithm. It can be used in some multi-tasks running on multiple nodes/servers, especially with/on RabbitMQ cluster.
